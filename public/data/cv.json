    "I was trained to be a programmer-economist, and my first experience was precisely in that field. It involved an accounting desktop product with a vast number of relations, reports, and complex SQL queries.",
    "When I hit the ceiling, a hobby emerged in the form of website development, which smoothly turned into a 24/7 occupation. Since then, I've been in the web.",
    "Over the past decade, I've worked on quite a large number of projects in various capacities and roles.",
    "I enjoy challenges, so I've been focused on startups that help create new opportunities for people. Each challenge involves a number of related technologies, and it's very fulfilling when I'm able to use new stacks to grow and improve the product I'm working on. That's why my new hobby is exploring new opportunities.",
    "More details over a cup of coffee."
